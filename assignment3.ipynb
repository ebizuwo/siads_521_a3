I do adhere to some of the rules but then again rules are meant to be broken. The story will not have a bunch of the data cleaning and stats gathering. That has been offloaded to a class file imported below. So that takes away from the rule 3 and 4 ability. But leaves room for displaying some of the charting with plotly and use of the **@interact** decorator. To be frank before I discovered this decorator I was going to use ipython widgets source to create the widgets which is what led me to create the class.
